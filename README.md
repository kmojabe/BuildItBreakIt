# World Visualizer
World visualizer is a data visualization application that allows users to view statistics such as HDI, Gini, GDP (PPP and nominal), population, and potentially others with time. The application utilizes pixel by pixel color comparisons of nations on the map. Users will have the ability to zoom in/out on nations and focus on that countries statistics alone. There will also be a timeline on the bottom of the page to adjust statistics by time.

* The HDI and Gini stats will be represented by adjusting the colors of the nations.
* GDP and Population stats will be represented by their relative size based on the world's total GDP/Population.
* Population will also be represented by blue dots across the globe based on a certain number people. This graphical view will allow users to see the population density across the globe.
* All of these statistics will be adjustable by dragging the timeline icon on the bottom of the page.
